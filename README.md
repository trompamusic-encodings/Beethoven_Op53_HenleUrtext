# DRAFT encoding template

This repository contains an [MEI](https://music-encoding.org) encoding of the **Sonata for Piano (Opus 53)** by Ludwig van Beethoven, 
following the [Henle Urtext edition, 1976. Plate HN1034](https://imslp.org/wiki/Special:ReverseLookup/621767).

We hope that this repository will eventually serve as an encoding template for wider use within the [TROMPA](https://trompamusic.eu) project. 
For now, no assurances are made regarding the validity or consistency of this encoding or its structure.
